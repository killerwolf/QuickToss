## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No supported files found"**: Make sure your folder contains images, PDFs, or text files
2. **App won't start**: Check that all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)

### Development Tips

- Use `npm run dev` for live development with hot reload
- Check the browser dev tools (Cmd+Option+I) for debugging
- The Electron main process logs appear in your terminal
- React component issues can be debugged in the Electron dev tools
