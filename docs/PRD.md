# QuickToss - MVP Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

### Vision Statement
QuickToss is a macOS application that gamifies file organization by allowing users to quickly review and categorize files in a Tinder-like interface, making the tedious task of file cleanup engaging and efficient.

### Problem Statement
Users accumulate files in folders over time, making it difficult to efficiently review and organize them. Traditional file management requires opening each file individually, which is time-consuming and tedious.

### Solution
A swipe-based interface that presents files one at a time with previews, allowing users to quickly decide whether to keep or delete files with simple swipe gestures.

## 2. Target Users

3. Show brief confirmation animation
4. Load next file
5. Repeat until folder is complete

### 6.3 Completion Flow
1. Show summary of actions taken
2. Option to review deleted files
3. Option to start with another folder

## 7. Success Metrics (MVP)

### 7.1 User Engagement

- **Completion rate**: Percentage of users who finish a folder

### 7.2 User Satisfaction
- **App Store rating**: Target 4.5+ stars
- **User feedback**: Positive sentiment in reviews
- **Retention**: Users return for multiple cleanup sessions

## 8. Constraints and Assumptions

### 8.1 Technical Constraints
