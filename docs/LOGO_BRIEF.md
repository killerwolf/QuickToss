# QuickToss Logo - Creative Brief

## üé® Logo Design Brief

### Project Overview
**QuickToss** is a Tinder-like file organization app that allows users to quickly organize their files by swiping left to delete or right to keep. The app has a modern, clean interface with a blue/indigo color scheme.

- Color scheme: Blue (#3B82F6) and green (#10B981) gradients, or monochromatic with accent colors
- Style: Flat design, modern, tech-forward but friendly
- Mood: Professional yet approachable, efficient, clean

### What to Avoid
- Overly complex designs
- Dated styles
- Anything that looks too corporate/formal
